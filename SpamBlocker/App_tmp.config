         count            - not required - "10"       - the number of times the rule need to be matched before an ip is blocked
         fileCount        - not required - "1"        - the newest <fileCount> files in the folder <readPath> will be checked for this rule
         delimiter        - not required - ","        - what symbol to split each line in the file on to isolate the ip-address
         ipIndex          - not required - "0"        - what the zero-indexd index is for the ip-address
         commentPattern   - not required - "#"        - if the file to be checked contains commented lines the starting symbol of those lines must be specified with this setting
         rangeCheck       - not required - "false"    - true/false if true check within a given range of ip-addresses instead of just individual ips
           maskSize       - not required - "24"       - max 32 how many bits different ip-addresses must match in order to be considered in the same range
           countUniqeIps  - not required - true       - true/false if false the same ip-address can be counted multiple times to be blocked
         doSearch         - not requried - off        - off/none/any/all  'off' implies no search will be done
